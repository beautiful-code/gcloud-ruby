      # # MutationEntry
      #
      # MutationEntry is a chainable structure that holds data for different
      # type of mutations.
      # MutationEntry is used in following data operations:
      #
      #   * Mutate row. See {Google::Cloud::Bigtable::Table#mutate_row}
      #   * Mutate rows. See {Google::Cloud::Bigtable::Table#mutate_rows}
      #   * Check and mutate row using a predicate.
      #     See {Google::Cloud::Bigtable::Table#check_and_mutate_row}
      #
      # @example
      #   entry = Google::Cloud::Bigtable::MutationEntry.new("user-1")
      #   entry.set_cell(
      #     "cf1", "fiel01", "XYZ", timestamp: Time.now.to_i * 1000
      #   ).delete_cells(
      #     "cf2",
      #     "field02",
      #     timestamp_from: (Time.now.to_i - 1800) * 1000,
      #     timestamp_to: (Time.now.to_i * 1000)
      #   ).delete_from_family("cf3").delete_from_row
      #
      # @example Using table
      #   require "google/cloud/bigtable"
      #
      #   bigtable = Google::Cloud::Bigtable.new
      #   table = bigtable.table("my-instance", "my-table")
