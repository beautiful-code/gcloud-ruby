    #
    # Cloud Spanner is a fully managed, mission-critical, relational database
    # service that offers transactional consistency at global scale, schemas,
    # SQL (ANSI 2011 with extensions), and automatic, synchronous replication
    # for high availability.
    #
    # For more information about Cloud Spanner, read the [Cloud
    # Spanner Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/spanner/docs/).
