# Release History

### 0.34.0 / 2019-02-01

* Switch to use Google::Cloud::PubSub namespace.
* Add PubSub on_error configuration.
* Major updates to Subscriber
  * Add dependency on current-ruby.
  * Updates are now made using unary API calls, not the gRPC stream.
  * Update Subscriber inventory lease mechanics:
    * This change will help avoid race conditions by ensuring that
      inventory lease renewal actions don't override ack/nack/delay
      actions made on a received message via the Subscriber callback.
  * Changes to avoid potential race conditions in updates.
* Add reference?/resource? helper methods:
  * Topic#reference?
  * Topic#resource?
  * Subscription#reference?
  * Subscription#resource?
* Add documentation for methods that will make an API call
  when called on a reference object.
  * Topic#labels
  * Subscription#topic
  * Subscription#deadline
  * Subscription#retain_acked
  * Subscription#retention
  * Subscription#endpoint
  * Subscription#labels
  * Subscription#exists?
  * Subscription#listen (without deadline optional argument)
* Add example code for avoiding API calls to Overview guide.
* Remove the #delay alias for modify_ack_deadline.
  * Users should use the modify_ack_deadline and modify_ack_deadline!
    methods directly instead.
* Make use of Credentials#project_id
  * Use Credentials#project_id
    If a project_id is not provided, use the value on the Credentials object.
    This value was added in googleauth 0.7.0.
  * Loosen googleauth dependency
    Allow for new releases up to 0.10.
    The googleauth devs have committed to maintaining the current API
    and will not make backwards compatible changes before 0.10.
