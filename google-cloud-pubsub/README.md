# google-cloud-pubsub

[Google Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/) ([docs](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/reference/rest/)) is designed to provide reliable, many-to-many, asynchronous messaging between applications. Publisher applications can send messages to a “topic” and other applications can subscribe to that topic to receive the messages. By decoupling senders and receivers, Google Cloud Pub/Sub allows developers to communicate between independently written applications.

## Quick Start

```sh
$ gem install google-cloud-pubsub
```

## Authentication

This library uses Service Account credentials to connect to Google Cloud services. When running on Compute Engine the credentials will be discovered automatically. When running on other environments the Service Account credentials can be specified by providing the path to the JSON file, or the JSON itself, in environment variables.

Instructions and configuration options are covered in the [Authentication Guide](https://googleapis.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/docs/google-cloud-pubsub/latest/file.AUTHENTICATION).

## Example

```ruby
require "google/cloud/pubsub"

pubsub = Google::Cloud::PubSub.new(
  project_id: "my-project",
  credentials: "/path/to/keyfile.json"
)

# Retrieve a topic
topic = pubsub.topic "my-topic"

# Publish a new message
msg = topic.publish "new-message"

# Retrieve a subscription
sub = pubsub.subscription "my-topic-sub"

# Create a subscriber to listen for available messages
subscriber = sub.listen do |received_message|
  # process message
  received_message.acknowledge!
end

# Start background threads that will call the block passed to listen.
subscriber.start

# Shut down the subscriber when ready to stop receiving messages.
subscriber.stop.wait!
```

## Enabling Logging

To enable logging for this library, set the logger for the underlying [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/tree/master/src/ruby) library. The logger that you set may be a Ruby stdlib [`Logger`](https://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.5.0/libdoc/logger/rdoc/Logger.html) as shown below, or a [`Google::Cloud::Logging::Logger`](https://googleapis.github.io/google-cloud-ruby/docs/google-cloud-logging/latest/Google/Cloud/Logging/Logger) that will write logs to [Stackdriver Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/). See [grpc/logconfig.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/lib/grpc/logconfig.rb) and the gRPC [spec_helper.rb](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/ruby/spec/spec_helper.rb) for additional information.

Configuring a Ruby stdlib logger:

```ruby
require "logger"

module MyLogger
  LOGGER = Logger.new $stderr, level: Logger::WARN
  def logger
    LOGGER
  end
end

# Define a gRPC module-level logger method before grpc/logconfig.rb loads.
module GRPC
  extend MyLogger
end
```

## Supported Ruby Versions

This library is supported on Ruby 2.3+.

Google provides official support for Ruby versions that are actively supported
by Ruby Core—that is, Ruby versions that are either in normal maintenance or in
security maintenance, and not end of life. Currently, this means Ruby 2.3 and
later. Older versions of Ruby _may_ still work, but are unsupported and not
recommended. See https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/branches/ for details
about the Ruby support schedule.

## Versioning

This library follows [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

It is currently in major version zero (0.y.z), which means that anything may
change at any time and the public API should not be considered stable.
